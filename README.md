## About

<p align="justify">
  Succeeding the release of the <i>Clear Card Arc</i>, a huge fan of the series created this repository after he got as excited about the new season as he was with the first one many years ago. It's too soon to say what you'll find here, but it can become anything.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Maybe it is just a escape for nostalgic feelings, but I hope that other fans may find it and remember the joy that Kinomoto Sakura brought us while chasing the Clow Cards.
